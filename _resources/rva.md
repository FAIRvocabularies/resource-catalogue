A service built on sharing
Research Vocabularies Australia helps you find, access, and reuse vocabularies for research. Some vocabularies are hosted by the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) and can be accessed directly through Research Vocabularies Australia. Otherwise Research Vocabularies Australia provides a link to the vocabulary ownerâ€™s web page.

Research Vocabularies Australia also allows you to create and/or publish a vocabulary as well as integrate an existing vocabulary into your own system.

Vocabularies for the research community
Research Vocabularies Australia caters for researchers and those who support, describe and discover research, including vocabulary managers, ontologists, data managers and librarians.

Through engagement with the research community, Research Vocabularies Australia will grow to cover a broad spectrum of research fields - across sciences, social sciences, arts and humanities. Many of the vocabularies you can discover here are immediately accessible, either directly through Research Vocabularies Australia or via partners and publishers, and are free to use (subject to licence conditions).
